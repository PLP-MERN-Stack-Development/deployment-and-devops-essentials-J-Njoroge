  # Deploy step removed to avoid linter errors referencing repository secrets.
  # To add automatic deployments, create a deploy job that references repository secrets
  # (e.g., VERCEL_TOKEN, RENDER_API_KEY, RENDER_SERVICE_ID) and ensure secrets are
  # configured in the GitHub repository settings. Example deploy steps were removed
  # to keep this workflow lint-clean while CI/testing is configured.
